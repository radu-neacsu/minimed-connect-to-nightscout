# minimed-connect-to-nightscout

[MiniMed Connect] is a device which communicates with a Medtronic insulin pump over 916MHz radio to gather data about pump status. This data may include readings from an Enlite continuous glucose monitor (CGM). The Connect forwards pump data via Bluetooth LE to a [proprietary app][connect-app] running on an iPhone. The iPhone app uploads the data to Medtronic's servers, enabling authorized users to view it on the [Medtronic CareLink Connect][carelink] website.

[Nightscout] is an open source, DIY project that allows real-time access to CGM data on any platform. The core of the Nightscout project is [cgm-remote-monitor], a web service which can receive and broadcast CGM data using a Mongo database. Various other software projects communicate with an instance of `cgm-remote-monitor`, either to transmit data from a CGM device, or to display that CGM data on a computer, smartphone/tablet, or smartwatch.

**minimed-connect-to-nightscout** is a web scraper which sends data from Medtronic CareLink Connect to Nightscout. It does so by posing as a web browser, logging into CareLink Connect, periodically downloading pump status data from the Medtronic server, and uploading that data to a Nightscout server.

## Prerequisites

* A [MiniMed Connect] and compatible Medtronic insulin pump
* An iPhone running the [MiniMed Connect app][connect-app]
* Username and password for a [CareLink][carelink] account linked to the Connect
* A working Nightscout website and Mongo database

## Installation on Azure

The easiest installation mode is to set up an instance of Nightscout [cgm-remote-monitor] on Azure and enable the `mmconnect` plugin. This module is packaged with Nightscout 0.8.2+ and can pull data from CareLink Connect as part of the web server process. Follow [this guide][azure-install].

## Installation on Heroku

Another turnkey installation option is to run this on a Heroku worker dyno. You may find this more reliable than Azure. Follow the [Share2 Bridge instructions for Heroku], substituting this repo for `share2nightscout-bridge`.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## Installation in general

1. Install [Docker].
1. Clone this repository.
1. Set environment variables (see below).
1. run `docker-compose up -d`.

### Required environment variables

Copy .env.sample as .env and replace the <<palce-holders>> with correct information
* `CARELINK_USERNAME` - your username for [CareLink][carelink]
* `CARELINK_PASSWORD` - your password for [CareLink][carelink]
* `API_SECRET` - the value you use for `API_SECRET` on your Nightscout website
* `WEBSITE_HOSTNAME` - the hostname for your Nightscout instance, which looks like `your.host.com`. If you are running this script in the same Azure environment as Nightscout, there is no need to set this, as it will [already be set by Azure][azure-environment]. If you set `NS` (see below), you do not need to set this.

### Optional environment variables

* `CARELINK_REQUEST_INTERVAL` - number of milliseconds to wait between requests to the CareLink server (default: 60000)
* `CARELINK_SGV_LIMIT` - maximum number of recent sensor glucose values to send to Nightscout (default: 24)
* `CARELINK_MAX_RETRY_DURATION` - maximum number of seconds to spend retrying failed requests to CareLink, ideally a power of 2 (default: 512)
* `CARELINK_QUIET` - set to a truthy value to not output details of CareLink and Nightscout requests to the console (default: empty)
* `MMCONNECT_SERVER` - set to `EU` if you are based in Europe / using Guardian Connect
* `NS` - a fully-qualified Nightscout URL (e.g. `https://sitename.azurewebsites.net`) which overrides `WEBSITE_HOSTNAME`

## Restarting container

1. run `docker-compose down`
1. run `docker-compose up -d --build`


## Currently supported data

* Sensor glucose values and trend (single/double arrow up/down)
* Pump: active insulin, reservoir level, battery level
* MiniMed Connect: battery level, connection status to phone, connection status to pump
* Sensor: calibration state, time until next calibration, sensor duration, connection status to pump
* Pump model

Understanding of the current data is based mostly on [this analysis].

## API

[run.js] demonstrates how to use the key API features in production. A minimal example would look like:

```js
var mmcns = require('minimed-connect-to-nightscout');
var client = mmcns.carelink.Client({username: 'username', password: 'password'});
client.fetch(function(err, data) {
  if (!err) {
    var transformed = mmcns.transform(data);
    mmcns.nightscout.upload(transformed.entries, 'https://your.ns.host/api/v1/entries.json', 'api-secret', callback);
    // ...or:
    mmcns.nightscout.upload(transformed.devicestatus, 'https://your.ns.host/api/v1/devicestatus.json', 'api-secret', callback);
    // ...or use `transformed.entries` and `transformed.devicestatus` directly
  }
});
```

[File an issue] if you'd like to give feedback, request an enhancement, or report a bug.

Pull requests are welcome, provided they include tests. See `test/` for examples. Run `npm test` to run the suite.

Much of the Medtronic HTTP interaction is based on the excellent work by @bewest and @ianjorgensen on [mmcsv].
